Milky Way
=========

Turn based strategy game from Milky Way galaxy

Overview
--------

The project is still starting. I'm searching for collaborators.


Getting started
---------------

Download source code from [GitHub page](https://github.com/FedericoRessi/milkyway)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FedericoRessi/milkyway.git 
```

How to use
----------

There is still nothing to use. Only Python meat for now. ;-)


Run tests
---------

To run tests python2.7 and [Tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) are required.

From project root folder type following command:

```bash
tox
```

Tox does:

- execute all tests using [PyTest](http://pytest.org/latest/)
- execute code coverage
- execute static analisys (flake8 and pylint)

If some error is reported by Tox, it must be corrected before the change reaches master branch.
